# RESTRouting

This project shows RESTful routing on backend to dynamically show and edit information on the frontend. 

Databases are simulated for now and comments will reset if the server is reset. 

Inside you can view, edit, create and delete posts/comments. Choose localhost:3000/tacos for a simple GET and POST simulation and choose localhost:3000/comments to view CRUD system.

Future updates may include:
-Implementation to other pages to simulate comments/posts on other projects
-Styling
