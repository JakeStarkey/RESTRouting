# RESTful Routing

This main branch is the updated, back end directory-based code for my project, RESTful Routing. 

This project shows RESTful routing on backend to dynamically show and edit information on the frontend. 

Code is now capable of communicating with Monodb backend.

Inside you can view, edit, create and delete posts/comments. localhost:3000/products is the main page. Run seeds.js to fill backend with generic information to begin viewing. 

Features currently capable:
-Dynamic information based on requests sent to server
-adding, viewing, updating and deleting new information received

Future updates may include:
-hosting on an actual URL
-stylization
